# OpenSSL Vulnerability Analysis

I wrote a [small script](https://github.com/manuels/rusty-tls-blog/blob/openssl-vulns/openssl-vuln/parse.py) that downloads [all vulnerabilities](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html) and their short description. Then I extract some keywords and try to cluster the vulnerabilities. This clustering is not really successfull (Some clusters are huge, some others are extremly small).

## Statistics
However, we can extract [some statistics about the vulnerabilities](https://github.com/manuels/rusty-tls-blog/blob/openssl-vulns/openssl-vuln/output.txt) (134 in total):

 - 6 integer {over,under}flows
 - 11 memory corruptions
 - 7 oracles
 - 5 timing attacks
 - 14 buffer over-flows/under-flows/over-reads
 - 20 null pointer dereferences (!)
 - 8 double-frees
 - 2 free-after-uses
 - 8 memory leaks
 - 5 race conditions

(these categories are overlapping)

I skimmed the list and I guess that ~50 of these vulnerabilities would be solved if OpenSSL were implemented by Rust (null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, ...), so we would be left with [this list](https://github.com/manuels/rusty-tls-blog/blob/openssl-vulns/openssl-vuln/output-possibly-unsolved-by-rust.txt).

That's about *one third* of all vulnerabilities. Not bad.
